Despite the vast evolution of the available ways used to interact with current mobile devices, their fundamental principle has not been alternated; assuming that only 2-dimensional (x-y position) input can be extracted. We introduce Fat Finger, in an attempt to utilize the contact size of the finger touching the screen as an additional (3\textsuperscript{rd}) dimension of input. The aim is to comprehend the capabilities and precision we can acquire, when using contact size as the principal source of input.An experiment implementation was achieved in the form of target selection tasks, aiming to realize the impact of visual feedback, size and position of targets, with the utter target being to set a limit for the maximum perceivable contact size levels.A user study was performed, where users had to precisely hit predefined targets, by alternating the contact size between their finger and the screen. We found that eight (8) is the upper limit of distinguishable contact size levels that users can perceive when visual feedback is supplied, which drops down to three (3) otherwise.\cleardoublepage%Dedication\chapter*{}\Large\vspace{5cm}\emph{To family, friends and the art of dance...}\cleardoublepage\normalsize\chapter*{Acknowledgements}As the saying goes, good premises do not entail good stories.
